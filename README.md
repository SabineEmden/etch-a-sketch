This project for JavaScript Basics in the Foundations Course of The Odin Project uses DOM manipulation and events.

Assignment: [Project: Etch-a-Sketch](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

The page shows a sketch pad with an invisible grid of square cells. The cells change color when the mouse is moved over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through the grid.

The page loads with a 16x16 grid. When the user clicks a button above the grid, they are asked for the number of squares per side for a new grid. After the number is entered, the existing grid is removed and a new grid is generated in the same total space as before.
